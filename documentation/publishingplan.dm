Perfect! Let’s go step by step. Since your topic is Formal Epistemology + Python library, we’ll combine the norms of philosophy publishing with open-access sharing for reproducibility. I’ll also explain copyright considerations.

Step 1: Write Your Article in VSCode

Use Markdown or LaTeX in VSCode (LaTeX is standard for philosophy journals, but Markdown can be converted to LaTeX with Pandoc).

Include:

Abstract

Introduction / Motivation

Formal definitions and results

Examples / computational experiments

Link to your Python library (e.g., via GitHub or Zenodo DOI)

Discussion / Conclusion

Tips:

Clearly mark what is theoretical vs computational.

Include reproducibility info: dependencies, versions, code snippets.

Step 2: Preprint / Open Access First

In philosophy and formal epistemology, it’s common to upload a preprint before peer review.

Platforms:

PhilArchive (philarchive.org) – widely recognized in philosophy.

arXiv (arxiv.org) – use cs.HC, cs.LO, or math.LO if your paper has computational content.

Zenodo – if you want to also archive your Python library and get a DOI.

Copyright / License:

You can choose CC-BY license (most open, allows others to reuse with attribution) or CC-BY-NC (non-commercial).

Make sure to state clearly: “This is a preprint, under [chosen license].”

✅ Preprint first is usually safe. Most journals in philosophy allow submitting a manuscript that is already on PhilArchive or arXiv.

Step 3: Submit to a Peer-Reviewed Journal

Since your topic is Formal Epistemology + Computational Tool, look for journals that accept methodological or computational philosophy papers. Examples:

Journal of Philosophical Logic – formal epistemology, logic-heavy.

Erkenntnis – top-tier for epistemology, philosophy of science; accepts formal/computational approaches.

Synthese – formal epistemology, philosophy of science, also interdisciplinary.

Philosophers’ Imprint – open-access journal, friendly to computational or new-methods papers.

Tips:

Include link to your Python library in GitHub/Zenodo in a reproducibility section.

Emphasize your contribution: formal epistemology + computational tool.

Step 4: Workflow

Here’s a recommended sequence:

Write the article in VSCode (Markdown/LaTeX). Include code link.

Upload preprint on PhilArchive or arXiv with CC-BY license.

Submit to journal for peer review.

After acceptance, update preprint if needed with DOI or journal reference.

This sequence preserves open access and journal rights. Most philosophy journals explicitly allow preprints, but check their “preprint policy”.

If you want, I can draft a minimal reproducible preprint template in LaTeX for your article, with code-link section ready to submit to PhilArchive/arXiv and later to a journal.
